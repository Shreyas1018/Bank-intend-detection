# Bank-intend detection using LSTM

# Summary:

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to classify customer inquiries into intent classes for a banking dataset.<br>
The goal is to improve automated chatbot or customer service efficiency by accurately understanding the core reasons behind customer interactions.
# Problem Statement:

Customer service in banking often involves handling a wide variety of inquiries, leading to delays and inefficiencies if routed manually.
Automating intent detection can streamline inquiries, ensuring customers are connected to the right resources quickly.
# Dataset:

The Bank Dataset (Provide more details if possible: source, size, structure).
# Intent Classes:
- User Information related issue
-  Debit/Credit card related issues
-   Transaction related issues
  
# Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, and encoding.
LSTM Model Development: Building an LSTM architecture for sequence classification.<br>
Training and Evaluation: Training the model on the Bank Dataset, using accuracy and relevant metrics for evaluation.<br>

# Technologies:
Python<br>
TensorFlow/Keras<br>
NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (and other relevant libraries)<br>
